                <p>
                    At TELUS, our goal is to make sure that you are not only familiar with, but also very comfortable using the TELUS IQ Portal to fulfill and manage your wireless device needs. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once your company buys the TELUS wireless service, you will be assigned a dedicated concierge to assist you during the first 45 days. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will receive a welcome call from your concierge, and during that call you will book a day and time for a 90-minute, hands-on training session for you and any other administrators who will have access to the self-serve portal. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Before your training session</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Prior to your training session, you must do the following:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure you have access to the latest browser version of Chrome, IE or Firefox</li>
                    <li>Download the Cisco WebEx applet, which will require administrative access to your laptop of computer</li>
                    <li>Invite all colleagues/administrators who will use TELUS IQ to the training session</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Explore on your own first</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your concierge will send a Cisco WebEx invite to you and your colleagues for the day and time of your training session. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The invite will include instructions on how to access the TELUS IQ demo environment. We encourage you and your colleagues to explore TELUS IQ freely on your own before your training session. This is strictly a practice environment. Any changes you make will not impact your actual account.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be sure to note any questions or concerns you have to address with your concierge during your training session.
                </p>
