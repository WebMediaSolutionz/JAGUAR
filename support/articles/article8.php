                                    The Organize feature is visible only to the Super Administrator's account. It is used to tag and group subscribers into company accounts, and can be used to reconfigure subscriber(s) Organization Tags.

                                    For example, you would need to reconfigure a subscriber's account if a company employee moves to a different department in which the subscribers are under a different rate plan.
