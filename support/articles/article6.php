                    <strong>What information can I get from an invoice report?</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, only the Super Administrator can run an invoice report. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    An invoice report is a report based on 30-day billing cycles. It provides an aggregated view of your company’s total monthly spend for all accounts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The total monthly spend is broken down into:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Monthly service fee</li>
                    <li>Voice usage and charges</li>
                    <li>Long distance (domestic and international) usage and charges</li>
                    <li>Roaming voice usage and charges</li>
                    <li>Data (domestic and roaming) usage and charges</li>
                    <li>Roaming data usage and charges</li>
                    <li>SMS usages and charges</li>
                    <li>Feature charges</li>
                    <li>Other charges</li>
                    <li>Discounts – data and other services</li>
                    <li>Taxes</li>
                    <li>Adjustments</li>
                    <li>Total charges</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In addition, you can see:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>YTD average: From January to the query date, divided by the number of months.</li>
                    <li>YTD difference: Difference between the month chosen and the YTD average.</li>
                    <li>
                        YTD average per user: From January to the query date, divided by the total number of subscribers during those months.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Current average per user: Total spend divided by total number of subscribers in month chosen.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You can request an invoice report for any period from the day the system began collecting data on your account. (e.g. last month, last three months or last year)
                </p>
