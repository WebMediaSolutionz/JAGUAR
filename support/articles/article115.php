                <h3>A device is not working. Any suggestions?</h3>

                <p>
                    There may be a few reasons why a device is not working. Try these basic troubleshooting steps for specific problems:   
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Restart the device</strong> - Remove the battery and SIM card from the device, wait for few seconds and insert the SIM card and battery. Turn on the device. If the battery can be removed, perform a soft reset by restarting the device using the power button on the phone, which is equivalent to a battery pull.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Power and charging problems</strong> – Try using another cable, wall plug or battery if it is removable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>SIM card error or problems connecting to network</strong> – Remove the SIM card and place it into another handset and/or put another SIM card in the device to confirm it is a handset issue. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If the device needing repair was previously reported as lost or stolen, it cannot access the network. If a lost/stolen device has been found and needs repair, you must call TELUS at 1-888-256-8315, press Option 4 then Option 1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Problems with speaker volume, microphone or image quality</strong> - Make sure all protective plastics on the device have been removed. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the device problem is not fixed using the above suggestions, you can send the device to TELUS for repair. See "How do I submit a device for repair?"
                </p>
