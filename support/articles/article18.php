                </p>

                <p>
                    Note under Status, it says "Pending devices &amp; plan".

                    To upgrade another sub-group of subscribers with the <span class="italics">same devices and features</span> (that are different from the previous group), simply check the boxes next to their mobile numbers, and repeat the process above.
