                <p>
                    This reason for this is likely that you prepared your order, but you did not submit it until later. During that time, the device(s) you selected were sold.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    TELUS IQ will not allow your order to be processed if a device is out of stock. You must login and select another in-stock device to complete your order.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    For more information on a device that is unavailable, please contact our dedicated Help Desk at 1-888-256-8315 (Select Option 4 for TELUS IQ).
