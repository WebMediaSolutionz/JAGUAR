                                If a subscriber account status is “Suspended – Stolen”, and the device was found or returned, the Subscription Status cannot be changed online.

                                The stolen device was entered into a central database to prevent it from being used maliciously.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you want to reactivate a stolen device, you must call TELUS at 1-888-256-8315, press 4 then press 1.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                To reactivate service for a stolen device, you must call TELUS at 1-888-256-8315 (press 4 then press 1). You cannot reactivate the device online through Jaguar. 
                            </p>

                                When a device is identified as stolen, Jaguar enters the information in a central database to prevent it from being used maliciously. We need to remove the device information from this database before the subscriber can use the device again.
