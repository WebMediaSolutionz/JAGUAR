                <h3>An employee thought his phone was stolen, but it has been found. How do I reactivate the service?</h3>

                <p>
                    To reactivate service for a stolen device, you must call TELUS at 1-888-256-8315 (press 4 then press 1). You cannot reactivate the device online through TELUS IQ. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When a device is identified as stolen, the device information is entered into a central database to prevent it from being used maliciously. We need to remove the device information from this database before the subscriber can use the device again.
