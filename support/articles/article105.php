                    The SIM number is a long 19-digit number that uniquely identifies a SIM card and is linked to a specific mobile device number and account. The SIM number is printed on the back of your SIM card and also stored inside it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The SIM number is also referred to as the Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICCID).
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may be required to find the SIM number to move a device from one carrier to another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>To find the SIM number</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the device has a removable back and battery, you can remove the SIM card and find the number right on the back of the card. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If this isn't possible, you can find the SIM card number without having to remove it from the phone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>On an iPhone</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Settings -> General -> About -> ICCID
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>On an Android phone</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Android systems vary, but in general you can find the SIM number by going to:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Settings -> About or About Phone or About Device -> Phone Identity or Status -> ICCID or IMSI
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>If the above directions donâ€™t work</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can download a simple app called SIM Card Info that provides information stored on the SIM card.
