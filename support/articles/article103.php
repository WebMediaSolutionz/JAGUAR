                <p>
                    As a TELUS client, you may be eligible for financing, which means that you pay off each device in monthly installments over a 2- or 3-year term. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    How it works:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A device is valued at $650. You opt for a 24-month payment plan.</li>
                    <li>You may make a down payment of $50, leaving a balance of $600.</li>
                    <li>All taxes on the full cost of the device are charged upfront.</li>
                    <li>You pay $25/month without tax for 24 months.</li>
                    <li>If you decide to upgrade the device in the middle of your contract term, you must pay the balance remaining prior to upgrading.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When you login to your TELUS IQ account, the prices you see are those negotiated in your Corporate Client Agreement (CCA).
                </p>

                <p>
                    For more details, please refer to your CCA and/or speak with your TELUS Sales Account Manager. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Are the devices shown the same ones negotiated in our contract?
