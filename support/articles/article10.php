                                Currently, only the Customer Master Administrator can run an invoice report. The invoice report provides a high-level view of monthly spend for all accounts within a company or organization. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                LOCATION: Manage -> Analytics -> I just noticed that there are menu items on the far left (Invoice Analytics). We need to include these in the path. At some point there will be more than one option.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To run a report, click on "Run New Report".
                            </p>

                                Try a compound screen shot. You can get the Invoice Analytics picture bigger by making the browser window narrower when you take the shot. This should eliminate the extra width in the tri-panes (Select Accounts, Filters, etc). I also cropped the right side.

                                Name your report, select your billing account number(s) (BAN), filter your report by selecting the Organization Tags, select the start and end dates for the report, and provide an email address to receive a notification when your report is complete.
