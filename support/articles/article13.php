                                I think you can combine these two actions as shown above and then pull out a note about the category. I would create a unique paragraph style for notes similar to the Location paragraph. It makes them easier to spot.Add Features – You can add features to subscribers’ rate plans by selecting Add Features, but all selected subscribers must be within the same category. 
                            </p>

                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Remove Features - You can remove features from subscribers’ rate plans by selecting Remove Features, but all selected subscribers must be within the same category. 
                            </p>
