                                Each Jaguar customer has a Customer Master Administrator (Master Admin) and a number of Customer Administrators (Customer Admin). 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The Customer Master Administrator has an overall view of all departments (or accounts) across the entire organization. The Customer Master Administrator has the authority to view and provision devices, view rate plans and invoices, create activation orders, purchase SIM cards for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) plans, and set up organization tags. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The Customer Master Administrator has the ability to assign an administrator to each entity or department within an organization. These administrators are called Customer Administrators.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Customer Administrators have access only to the specific billing account number (BAN) that is assigned to their individual departments. Customer Administrators can perform the same activities as Customer Master Administrator within their own departments - with the exception of setting up organization tags. (View and provision devices, view rate plans and invoices, create activation orders, purchase SIM cards for BYOD plans.)
