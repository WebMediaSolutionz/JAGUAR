                </p>

                <img src="../images/article12b.jpg" />

                <p>
                    The "Change Rate Plan" box will appear indicating your current service category (e.g. Voice &amp; Data Lite). Click the down arrow in the Target Rate Plan box, and you'll see the different plans available in your category.

                <img src="../images/article12c.jpg" />

                <p>
                    Click on a rate plan. A window with a description of the rate plan and its included features appears. These features cannot be changed. You will also see a list of optional features that may be added to the plan at a later time. 
                </p>

                <img src="../images/article12d.jpg" />

                <p>
                    To see the features of other rate plans within your category, simply click on another plan in the Target Rate Plan drop down menu. (Under Select Plan.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you decide on a new rate plan, set the Effective Date, and click Apply. (Changes can be future-dated.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your request is complete when you see a black flag in the Action Status coluumn. (It takes about 60 seconds.)

                <p>
                    Select the subscribers by clicking the boxes next to the account name keeping in mind that all selected subscribers must have rate plans within the same category linked to the same BAN (Business Account Number). 
                </p>

                    <strong>Changing a rate plan outside of your category</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the time of your contract negotiations, your subscribers or groups of subscribers were assigned to one of seven Rate Plan Categories:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Voice</li>
                    <li>Data</li>
                    <li>Voice &amp; Data</li>
                    <li>Voice &amp; Data Light</li>
                    <li>Data Light</li>
                    <li>Other</li>
                    <li>BlackBerry</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You can only change rate plans that are available within your category.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you wish to change a rate plan outside of your category â€“ for example, switching from a Voice plan to a Voice &amp; Data plan, you will need to contact TELUS at 1-888-256-8315.
