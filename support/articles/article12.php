                                At the time of your contract negotiations, your subscribers or groups of subscribers were assigned to one of seven Rate Plan Categories:
                            </p>

                            <ul>

                              <li>Data</li>
                              <li>Voice &amp; Data</li>
                              <li>Voice &amp; Data Light</li>
                              <li>Data Light</li>
                              <li>Other</li>
                              <li>BlackBerry</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                You can only change rate plans that are available within your category.
                            </p>

                              Manage -> Services -> I would try to consolidate the steps with a compound screen shot and a more comprehensive navigation path.

                                Select the subscriber(s) by clicking the boxes next to the account names keeping in mind that all selected subscribers must have rate plans within the same category linked to the same BAN (Business Account Number). Suggestion: I would limit the instructions to changing the rate plan for a single subscriber. Then, at the end you can add a note about doing this for multiples and add the caveat about having to be in the same BAN. Then you don’t slow down the main instructions with side notes. Also, I wouldn’t show an error message -- it makes me think about bugs and problems.

                              The “Change Rate Plan” box will appear indicating your current service category (e.g. Voice &amp; Data Lite). Click the down arrow in the Target Rate Plan box, and you’ll see the different plans available in your category.

                              Click on a rate plan, and a window opens with a complete description of the rate plan and its included features. These features cannot be changed. You will also see a list of   optional features that may be added to your plan at a later time.

                              Your request will be processed in about 60 seconds. You can check the status of your request in the Action Status column. Your request is complete when you see a black flag. Do we talk about these flags anywhere else? I wonder what red and green mean.
