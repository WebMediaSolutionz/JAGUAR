                    <strong>Some items are missing from my submitted order. How did this happen?</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reason for this could be that you submitted an order with unselected items (items that were not checked off).
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you did not check off all items in your order, those unselected items are lost and you will have to prepare a new order for the missing items. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If all your items were checked off, and you are still missing items, please call 1-888-256-8315, and select Option 4.
